# Predictive-Sleep-Health-Analysis

## Overview
Predictive Sleep Health Analysis is an ML-driven project designed to provide insights into sleep disorders by analyzing sleep patterns and predicting potential health issues.

## Features
- Data-driven sleep pattern analysis
- Machine learning model for sleep disorder prediction
- Visual analytics for sleep health trends
- Customizable reports for health monitoring

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (IPYNB files)
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Predictive-Sleep-Health-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Predictive-Sleep-Health-Analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` files) to analyze sleep data.
- Train and evaluate ML models.
- Generate predictions based on new sleep data.

## Dataset
- The project uses publicly available sleep datasets.
- Custom datasets can also be used for analysis.
- The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
